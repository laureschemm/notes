- "Today's programming wisdom is to embrace the SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These guidelines ensure code maintainability, scalability, and reusability, which are crucial in a constantly evolving software landscape. Remember that clear, modular, and decoupled code is the cornerstone of efficient development and long-term project health." 

In detail:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one thing and do it well.
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities like classes, modules, etc., should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use; instead, interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more specific ones.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions.
